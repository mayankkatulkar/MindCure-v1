MindCure Emotional Intelligence Evaluation System

This system evaluates MindCure's emotional intelligence capabilities as a mental wellbeing chatbot,
inspired by the Nature research paper methodology. Instead of testing humans, we test the AI's
emotional competence in various scenarios.

Tests implemented:
1. STEM-inspired: Emotion Management in Conversations
2. STEU-inspired: Emotion Understanding and Recognition
3. GEMOK-B-inspired: Complex Emotional Blend Recognition
4. GECo-inspired: Emotion Regulation and Management in Therapy Context
