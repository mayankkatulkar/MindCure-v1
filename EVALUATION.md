## 🎯 Evaluation Methodology

### Research Framework Foundation

Our evaluation methodology is based on established EQ assessment frameworks from academic research literature, specifically adapted for therapeutic AI systems. The assessment measures four core dimensions of emotional intelligence:

#### 1. **STEU (Situational Test of Emotion Understanding)**
- Measures ability to identify and understand emotions in complex scenarios
- Tests empathetic recognition of user emotional states
- Evaluates contextual emotional awareness

#### 2. **STEM (Situational Test of Emotion Management)**
- Assesses effectiveness of emotion regulation strategies
- Measures ability to provide appropriate therapeutic guidance
- Tests practical coping mechanism recommendations

#### 3. **GEMOK (Geneva Emotional Competence Test - Blended)**
- Evaluates recognition of complex, blended emotions
- Tests understanding of mixed emotional states
- Measures nuanced emotional intelligence

#### 4. **GECo (General Emotional Competence)**
- Assesses therapeutic context appropriateness
- Measures professional mental health response quality
- Evaluates crisis intervention capabilities
